# CS1999-buggy-race-runner

This repo is the third of the three repos for Foundation Year CS1999's **Buggy Racing** project.
See documentation in the (private)
[buggy-race-server repo](https://github.com/RHUL-CS-Projects/CS1999-buggy-race-server)
for details.

The three repos are:

* [CS1999-buggy-race-server](https://github.com/RHUL-CS-Projects/CS1999-buggy-race-server) (staff only!)
* [CS1999-buggy-race-editor](https://github.com/RHUL-CS-Projects/CS1999-buggy-race-editor)
* [CS1999-buggy-race-runner](https://github.com/RHUL-CS-Projects/CS1999-buggy-race-runner) (this repo)

## Why is it empty?

The repo is currently empty — it's still just a placeholder — because we still haven't
written the race code:
[MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) + 
[YAGNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren't_gonna_need_it)
came into play getting CS1999 into action _at all_ so this third repo didn't get populated... yet ;-)

* excutes races offline (using downloaded `buggies.csv`) to produce results and a race log
  (that's then published on the race server — see the docs in that repo!)
* replays races graphically in the browser by consuming those race logs
